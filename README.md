TSP with MTZ formulation was modeled in PuLP and solved using Gurobi solver and following tasks were performed.

Task 1: Implement OR-Tools code to generate an initial solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Task 2: Use the OR-Tools solution as a warm start to solve the TSP.

Task 3: Perform parameter tuning to further improve the solution time of the Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model.

Task 4: Implement max Km to reduce the number of variables
